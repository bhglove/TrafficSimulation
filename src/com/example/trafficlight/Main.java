         * Example:
         * You have four vehicles, two cars and two trucks, that are at an intersection.
         * Two cars are going South, one is going East, and one is going West.
         * All cars arrive at the intersection at the same time, by default.
         * Because North and South are first in priority, the two cars are first.
         * The light for the North/South light is on for 5 minutes. After that time is
         * complete, the light changes to yellow for 2 minutes, and then red.
         * Once that light is red, the East/West light changes to green.
